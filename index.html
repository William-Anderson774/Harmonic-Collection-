      <h4> The inspiration and story behind this collection comes from all the iphone pictures I take of facades of the buildings around me in Manhattan and the greater city. The title "3 inch x 6 inch from 20 feet" is meant to be a corrolation between the size of an iphone and the average distance that I tend to photograph these sites, usually 20 feet away- across the street.</h4>
