</H2>  
<hr>
  Originally constructed in 1846, 43 Willow Place stands as the last remaining structure of a row of 5 adjoining Greek Revival Townhouses that were collectively known as Colonnade Row. Nesseled in the quiet streets of Brooklyn Heights, the classical revival house stands out against the more modern brick townhouses. The structure itself, with a large wooden portico supported by 4 columns and a large front patio would have once been a modest middle-class house, now stands as a striking architectural statement. Over time, the interiors have modernized and conformed to 21st-century housing design, but stays true to the characteristics of the almost 200 year old home.
