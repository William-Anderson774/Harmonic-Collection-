   <h1> #2  375 Park Ave, Seagram Building
   </h1>  
<hr>
<P1><div>The Seagram office tower, built in 1958 by modernist architect Ludwig Miles van der Rohe and Philip Johnson. The 38-story tower stands clear in the Mid-town skyline. At first the building seems unremarkable and uninteresting, but this building served as the first as its kind and a prime example of Modernist architecture in the city. The all steel and glass facade reflects the city it sits in and rests as a model for many other buildings in the city and beyond. </div>
