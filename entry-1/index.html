   <H1> #1  326, 328, 330 East 18th Street Houses
</H2>  
<hr>
<P1>The historic houses at 326, 328, and 330 East 18th Street were once a part of the “bouwerier” of Peter Stuyvesant. After the takeover of Manhattan from the English in 1664, he moved north out of the city and established the land where the houses currently sit. After his death, the entire miiture farm was left to Cornilia Stuyvesant Ten Broeck, who in 1852 leased the land out to men who worked in the construction field. One of the stipulations of the contract was that the men be put up in “good and substantial dwelling houses…,” resulting in the 3 beautiful Italianate-style houses. Set substantially back from the sidewalk and with cast-iron front porches, the houses are a stunning reminder of 19th-century ambition and a time of single-family dwellings across the city.
